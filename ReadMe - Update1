<> Files that can be loaded together as groups (or experiments):

      Group 1:
      
      - PFB - Sample Data 1.csv
      - PFB - Sample Data 2.csv
      
      Group 2:
      - PFB - Sample Data 1 - Updated.csv
      - PFB - Sample Data 2 - Updated.csv
      
      Group 3:
      - PFB - Alternative Sample Data 1.csv

<> Notes: 

      The files from 'Group 1' and 'Group 2' can be loaded together as 4 replciates. However, some values will be
      exactly the same between these four files. I suggest using the the 'Group 2' data instead of 'Group 1' data.
      The "PFB - Alternative Sample Data 1.csv" is the only file that represents a different experimental layout than other files.
      Thus the "PFB - Alternative Sample Data 1" should not to be loaded together with other files as another replicate in one go.
      To vilsialise another experiment re-run the whole script. Keep in mind that all data attached contain simulated
      and not real values.

      Of course you can test the code further yourself, by changing/adding the data specimens, timepoints data, or "Samples", 
      as long as the names of the two columns "Sample", and "Timepoint" remain unchanged and as long as these 
      are the last two columns in the data frame, and in the same order. The code may not also work should some values be NaNs.
      The "Timepoint" must be an integer, and "Sample" should be a string.
